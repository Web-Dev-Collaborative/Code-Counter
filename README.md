# Code-Counter
A simple program that strips comments and whitespace from a code file and provides summary statistics. This is **very minimal** at the moment, but I'd like to add more in the future (time permitting).

Load python code from a file, or paste into the window. Then, click CALC!

The code will update, stripped of comments and whitespace, along with various statistics.
